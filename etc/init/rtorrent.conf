# HALT, DON'T BREATHE ! One false movement and "brillian" upstart (it's part
# which is integrated into init) will hang on every start/stop operation(yes 
# it's means that your next reboot will be by pressing reset). 
# This bug is open since 2009, but spaceman seems to not give a damn.

# Yes, we have to specifiy it three times, because "marvellous" upstart doesn't

# job suitable only for obsolete shells)
